  FlubGw: a gateway system for distributing Flub outside of a node network.

  # Some definitions

  **Channel**
  A channel is as defined for `Flub.sub`.

  **Route**
  A route is a connection between two endpoints. A route is created with a
  channel to subscribe to on the local end of the route. Flub messages
  received on the local end are sent through the route to the remote end and
  re-published there via `Flub.pub`.

  **Gateway**
  A gateway is a server that accepts messages from a `route` and re-publishes
  then remotely

  Adds a route for flub messages on `channel` to the remote flub
  gateway in `route`.

  route_opts:
  1. sub_to_status: True to Flub.sub to route status reports. You will receive
    reports like this: `%Flub.Message{data: %{route: route(), status: :up | :down}, channel: :flubgw_route_status}`
  2. autoremove: True to automatically remove this route when the calling pid
  dies. False keeps the route around until it is manually removed. Do not set
  autoremove to true and then call `remove_direct_route` or
  `eliminate_direct_route`; doing so will cause a double-removal situation.
  Defaults to true.

  sub_opts:
  * See `Flub.sub` documentation.

  Returns `:ok` on success, `{:error, reason}` on failure.
